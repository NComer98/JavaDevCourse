# JavaDevProject
The product of a Computer Science course on Java software development.
<br> <br>
The course culminated in a program (the files of which are in "/Project3/") that takes a text file and produces a pie chart of the 'n' most frequent letters, with 'n' being a number defined by user input.

The exact specifications of the project can be found alongside the code in "/Project3/". <br> <br>
Project 2 served as a warm-up for project 3 by allowing me to grow accustomed to creating GUIs with Java and using Java classes (super-classes, sub-classes, and interfaces).
